# Post-Trade PnL Decomposition & Execution Analysis (SPY)

This project implements a post-trade analytics framework for SPY that reconstructs
trading ledger state and decomposes PnL into inventory, bid-ask spread, slippage,
and transaction fee components.

The goal is to diagnose strategy performance beyond headline returns by separating
market-driven PnL from execution-driven costs.
